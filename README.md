# Census-API
PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
A flask application making use of custom functions and data structures useful for pulling census data into pandas dataframes and csv files. The project includes HTML templates
and JavaScript files to create a multi-page interface.


PROJECT GOALS:
The short-term goal is for the app to easily collect census data for multiple geographies into one downwloadable, ready-to-use table.

Long-term, it should be easy for the data to be visually explored within the app using graphs and maps.
